1) MAKING RABRI :-
STEP1 - Pour 3 cups of milk to a heavy bottom pot. Bring it to a boil on a medium flame. Add kesar/saffron and keep stirring every few minutes to prevent burning.

STEP2 - Pour sugar. You can use organic and white sugar as well.\

STEP3 - Adjust the flame as desired to suit your convenience. Do not use high flame milk may overflow the pot. Kepp stirring every 2 to 3 minutes, moving aside the malai/creame that comes on top. Turn off when it gets condensed to half the quantity. Chill half of this in the fridge. Keep the rest in the same pot.

2) MAKING CHENNA FOR RASMALAI :-
STEP1 - While the rabri is getting done, bring 5 cups milk to a boil in another pot for making chenna/paneer. If you are using non-homogenised milk then take off the milk from the stove and allow to rest for 5mins. Then add the vinegar. If using homogenised milk, add the curd or lemon juice or vinegar once the milk comes to a boil.

STEP2 - Keep stirring until the milk curdes completely. If needed add more lemon juice or vinegar. Switch off the stove. 

STEP3 - When you see it has crdled completely, immediatly add ice cubes or cold water. This is very important to keep the chenna soft.

STEP4 - Drain it up in a thin clean muslin cloth.

STEP5 - Wrap up the paneer in the cloth bringing together all the edges. Put the cloth under running water, making sure the paneer is wraped well in the cloth. Rinse it well to remove the smell of lemon or vinegar. Tie up the paneer in the cloth. Squeeze off the excess water. Hang it up on a hook for 45mins to 1hr for the it to completely drain.

STEP6 - At this step you must have chenna that is just moist with no dripping water and not sticky. Knead it well until you get smooth, grain free and non-sticky chenna. You must not knead to the extent that chenna begins to release hrease or fats.

3) MAKING RASMALAI :-
STEP1 - Divide the chenna to 12 equal portions. Make balls and flatten them gently. If you find the edges cracked up, gently smoothen them. Cover and set them aside.

STEP2 - Bring 3 1/2 cups water to a boil with 1 cup refined sugar.

STEP3 - When the syrup begins to boil, add the cardamon powder.

STEP4 - When the syrup begins to boil rapidly, add flattened disccs of chenna. Cover immedietly and cook on a moderately high flame for exactly 9mins.

STEP5 - The siscs would have doubled in size. Keep it covered and take off the pot from the stove. Rest foe atleast 20mins.

STEP6 - Take out one by one and cool. Gently squeeze them in between your palms to remove the absorbed syrup. You can also do it wiyh a spatula and spoon.

STEP7 - Add them to the warm rabri.

STEP8 - Add chopped pistachios,almonds and cashews. You can also simmer for 1 10 2mins on a low flame for the milk to be absorbed by the discs. Do not overcook at this stage, they may break. Pour the chilled rabri to this and serve rasmalai chilled..
